# Fragment-Isotope-Distribution-Paper
Source code associated with the paper 'Approximating isotopic distributions of biomolecule fragment ions using tensor-product splines'

This repository contains all the source code necessary to reproduce the results from our paper. 
It consists of the code to generate the training data for the tensor product splines, generate the spline models, 
and to compare approximate isotope distributions to various theoretical and experimental isotope distributions.

Many of the scripts are tailored to our LSF cluster to perform parallel job execution. 
It's not neccessary to use these scripts, but they contain examples of how to execute the programs
and the values we used for various parameters.
